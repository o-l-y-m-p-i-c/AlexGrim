This unique setting allowed me to explore the distinctive makeup styles and trends of that era, from grunge-inspired looks to the bold and rebellious aesthetics of the rock music scene. It was a fascinating journey to help transport the characters and evoke the spirit of the '90s through makeup. Working on this project not only tested my skills but also ignited my nostalgia for that iconic decade, reminding me of the power of makeup to capture the essence of a bygone era in a contemporary setting.`,
